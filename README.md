## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is a single HTML file and can be deployed easily on several free platforms.

### Option 1: Netlify 

1.  Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  Drag and drop your `index.html` file into the upload area.
3.  Netlify will provide you with a live URL for your deployed site.

### Option 2: GitHub Pages

1.  Ensure your repository is named `your-username.github.io` for a root deployment, or something else for a sub-path deployment (e.g., `ai-career-coach`).
2.  Push your `index.html` file to the `main` branch.
3.  In your repository's **Settings**, go to the **Pages** tab.
4.  Select the `main` branch as the source and click **Save**.
5.  Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Note:** The current setup exposes your API key in the client-side code. For a personal project, this is acceptable, but it is not secure for a production application. **It is highly recommended to add HTTP referrer restrictions to your API key in the Google Cloud Console to prevent misuse.**

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* **User Accounts:** Allow users to sign in and save their chat history.
* **File Uploads:** Enable users to upload their resume as a PDF or DOCX file for analysis.
* **Dark Mode:** Implement a toggle for a dark color scheme.
* **Streaming Responses:** Show the AI's response as it's being generated for a more interactive feel.
